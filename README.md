# Hotel Room Reservation System - Developer Test

## Overview
This test assesses your ability to build a functional hotel room reservation system. You'll develop both backend and frontend components that work together to manage room bookings, availability, and cancellations.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Room Management**
   - The system should manage 6 rooms of different categories:
     - 2 Simple rooms (IDs: S1, S2)
     - 2 Premium rooms (IDs: P1, P2)
     - 2 Royal rooms (IDs: R1, R2)
   - Each room should have properties including: ID, category, description, price per night, and amenities
   
2. **Booking System**
   - Users should be able to:
     - Search for available rooms by date range
     - Book a room for a specific date range
     - View booking details
     - Cancel a booking
     - View room availability calendar/timeline
   
3. **Admin Features**
   - View occupancy/fulfillment rates
   - Get insights on room popularity
   - View all bookings (current and upcoming)

### Technical Requirements

#### Backend (Choose one)
- Python (Flask, Django, or FastAPI)
- Node.js (Express, Nest.js)
- Ruby (Rails, Sinatra)

#### Frontend (Choose one)
- HTML + JavaScript (vanilla)
- React.js
- Vue.js

#### Data Persistence
- You may use any database system or file-based storage
- A simple in-memory solution is acceptable if time is limited, but persistence is preferred

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

1. **Functionality (40%)**
   - All core features work as described
   - The system handles edge cases appropriately
   - No critical bugs in main user flows

2. **Code Quality (30%)**
   - Clean, readable code with consistent style
   - Appropriate architecture and separation of concerns
   - Efficient algorithms and data structures
   - Proper error handling

3. **Documentation (20%)**
   - Clear setup and running instructions
   - API documentation (if applicable)
   - Architecture explanation and technology choices
   - Assumptions and limitations documented

4. **Extra Features (10%)**
   - Additional creative features beyond the requirements
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Extended functionality

## Bonus Ideas (Optional)
Consider implementing any of these features for bonus points:
- User authentication system
- Responsive design for multiple device types
- Email confirmation for bookings/cancellations
- Room ratings and reviews
- Special offers or discounts
- Room service or additional amenities booking

## Submission Requirements

1. Fork this repository
2. Implement your solution
